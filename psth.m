% 
% Makes post-stimulus time histogram of (spike) time data in SPIKE_TIMES.
% Each data point in SPIKE_TIMES is a spike time (NaNs are ignored).
% SPIKE_TIMES is vectorised ( 'SPIKE TIMES = SPIKE_TIMES(:)' ) so the input
% data can have any shape or number of dimensions, but it will be treated
% as a 1D vector.
% 
% BIN_SIZE specifies the width of the bins in the PSTH in the same units as
% spike_times (e.g. seconds, milliseconds, etc). If not provided or left 
% empty this will be decided from the density of the data.
% 
% PSTH_WIN is a 2-element vector [TMIN TMAX] that specifies the time range 
% over which the PSTH is plotted, e.g. if SPIKE_TIMES includes spike times 
% over a 10 second period, but PSTH_WIN is [0 1], only spike times over the
% first second are included in the PSTH. If left blank this will be
% decided by the min and the max of the data.
%
% SHOW_PLOT is a boolean variable (0/1 or true/false) that indicates whether
% to plot the count data as a bar histogram or not. Default is true; set to
% false / 0 if you only need the counts but don't want to plot the figure.
% 
% 
% PSTH_HANDLE is a handle to the bar graph object that is used to plot the
% PSTH - this means that it will have the same properties as any matlab bar
% graph created with the 'bar' function, which can be modified for
% aesthetics by the user after running this script.
% 
% COUNTS provides the spike counts that are used for the histogram.
%
% BINEDGES provides the edges of the bins that are used for the histogram.
