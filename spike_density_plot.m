% FUNCTION [IMAGE_HANDLE, COUNT_DATA] = SPIKE_DENSITY_PLOT(SPIKE_DATA,SPLIT_DIM,BINS)
% 
% Make heatmap of spike density over time by trial or by channel; 
% effectively this turns a set of PSTHs into a visually pleasing image that
% may be easier to interpret than a rasterplot or superimposed PSTHs.
% 
% SPIKE_DATA: M*N*O matrix of spike times. In current Akerman lab
% 'ephys_data' format, the dimensions represent:
% M = number of channels
% N = number of trials
% O = number of spikes
% 
% NaNs are ignored (it is assumed that NaNs represent empty slots in the 
% SPIKE_DATA matrix.
% 
%
% SPLIT_DIM: Determines which dimension of SPIKE_DATA to display as individual 
% rows, and which to average over. E.g. for SPLIT_DIM == 1, output is a
% row for each channel and averages over N trials. SPLIT_DIM == 2 outputs a
% row for each individual trial and averages over M channels.
% (the only options are 1 or 2)
% 
% 
% BINS: specifies the time bins in which SPIKE_DATA points are pooled to 
% generate the histogram that determines the colour in the colour map.
% e.g. for BINS == [0:0.001:1] the function outputs a spike density plot
% of spikes falling between 0 and 1s, with 1ms time bins.
% 
% 
% IMAGE_HANDLE: A handle to the image plotted with MATLAB's IMAGESC function.
% 
% COUNT_DATA: The histogram count data that underlies the heatmap in the
% image. Use imagesc(COUNT_DATA) to recreate the heatmap.
