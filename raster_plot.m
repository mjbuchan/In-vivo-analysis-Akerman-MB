% 
% SPIKE_DATA: M*N*O matrix of spike times. In current Akerman lab
% 'ephys_data' format, the dimensions represent:
% M = number of channels
% N = number of trials
% O = number of spikes
% 
% 
% NaNs are ignored (it is assumed that NaNs represent empty slots in the 
% SPIKE_DATA matrix.
% 
%
% SPLIT_DIM: Determines which dimension of SPIKE_DATA to display as individual 
% rows, and which to pool together. E.g. for SPLIT_DIM == 1, output is a
% row for each channel and pools spikes over N trials. SPLIT_DIM == 2 gives
% a row for each individual trial and pools spikes over M channels.
% (the only options are 1 or 2)
% 
% SPACING: Determines the space between rows. Default for a sensible
% visualisation is 0.2.
% 
% LINE_HANDLES: Returns the line handles for the line objects in the raster
% plot.
